info2 : "Welcome to THE MAKING OF A NATION -- American history in VOA Special English. I m Steve Ember.  Today, we tell about life in the United States during the nineteen sixties.   The nineteen sixties began with the election of the first president born in the twentieth century -- John Kennedy. For many Americans, the young president represented a spirit of hope for the nation. When Kennedy was murdered in nineteen sixty-three, many felt that their hopes died, too. This was especially true of young people, and members and supporters of minority groups.  A time of innocence and hope soon began to look like a time of anger and violence. More Americans protested to demand an end to the unfair treatment of black citizens. Many more protested to demand an end to the war in Vietnam. And many protested to demand full equality for women.  By the middle of the nineteen sixties, it had become almost impossible for President Lyndon Johnson to leave the White House without facing protesters against the war in Vietnam.  In March of nineteen sixty-eight, Johnson announced that he would not seek another term in office.  In addition to President Kennedy, two other influential Americans were murdered during the nineteen sixties. Civil rights leader Martin Luther King Junior was shot in Memphis, Tennessee, in nineteen sixty-eight. Several weeks later, Robert Kennedy -- John Kennedy s brother -- was shot in Los Angeles, California. He was campaigning to win his party s nomination for president.  The two murders resulted in riots in cities across the country. The unrest and violence affected many young Americans. The effect seemed especially bad because of the time in which they had grown up.   In nineteen sixty-seven, poet Allen Ginsberg helped lead a gathering of hippies in San Francisco. No one knows exactly how many people considered themselves hippies. But twenty thousand attended the gathering.  Another leader of the event was Timothy Leary.    Now, energy comes ...   He was a former university professor and researcher. Leary urged the crowd in San Francisco to  tune in and drop out.  This meant they should use drugs and leave school or their job. One drug that was used in the nineteen sixties was lysergic acid diethylamide, or LSD. LSD causes the brain to see strange, colorful images. It also can cause brain damage.  Some people say the Beatles  song  Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds  was about LSD.  As many Americans were listening to songs about drugs and sex, many others were watching television programs with traditional family values. These included  The Andy Griffith Show  and  The Beverly Hillbillies.  At the movies, some films captured the rebellious spirit of the times.  These included  The Graduate  and  Doctor Strangelove.     Deterrence is the art of producing, in the mind of the enemy, the fear to attack.  And so, because of the automated and irrevocable decision-making process, which rules out human meddling, the Doomsday Machine is terrifying and simple to understand, and completely credible and convincing.     Gee, I wish we had one of them Doomsday Machines.   Others offered escape through spy adventures, like the James Bond films. Women s groups, for example, were seeking equality with men. They wanted the same chances as men to get a good education and a good job. They also demanded equal pay for equal work.    A widely popular book on women in modern America was called  The Feminine Mystique.  It was written by Betty Friedan and published in nineteen sixty-three. The idea known as the feminine mystique was the traditional idea that women have only one part to play in society. They are to have children and stay at home to raise them. In her book, Ms. Friedan urged women to establish professional lives of their own.  In the early nineteen sixties, a committee was appointed to investigate the condition of women. It was led by Eleanor Roosevelt. She was a former first lady. The committee s findings helped lead to new rules and laws. The nineteen sixty-four Civil Rights Act guaranteed equal treatment for all groups. This included women. After the law went into effect, however, many activists said it was not being enforced. The National Organization for Women -- NOW -- was started in an effort to correct the problem.  The movement for women s equality was known as the women s liberation movement. Activists were called  women s libbers.  They called each other  sisters.  Early activists were usually rich, liberal white women. Later activists included women of all ages, women of color, rich and poor, educated and uneducated. They acted together to win recognition for the work done by all women in America. "
