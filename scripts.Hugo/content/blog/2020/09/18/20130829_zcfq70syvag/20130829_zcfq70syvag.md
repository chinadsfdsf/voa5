info2 : "Commercials in the 50 s...TV shows and advertisements - Ronald Reagan..Westinghouse commerical...Chevrolet commercial.. STEVE EMBER: Welcome to THE MAKING OF A NATION -- American history in VOA Special English. I m Steve Ember. (MUSIC) World War Two finally ended in August of nineteen forty-five. Life in the United States began to return to normal. Soldiers began to come home and find jobs. Factories stopped producing war materials and began to produce goods for peacetime. Millions of Americans moved out of cities and small towns. They bought newly built homes in suburban communities outside busy cities. Today, we look at the growth of suburbs and other changes in the American population in the years after World War Two. WIFE:  And we ll have the living room right in here, and the kitchen right here so we can see the children playing in the yard.  HUSBAND:  Yeah, the children ... Children? Say, how many are you planning on? Not more than six, I hope. Maybe I better add a few more rooms back here.  A couple in a marketing film for the home building industry. The United States counts its population every ten years. The first census took place in seventeen ninety. At that time, the country had about four million people. One hundred years later, in eighteen ninety, the population was sixty-three million. By nineteen fifty, there were more than one hundred fifty million people living in the United States. Things changed after World War Two. (SOUND) Suddenly, it seemed like every family started having babies. Parents were hopeful about the future. There were lots of jobs. People felt the need for a family and security after the long, difficult years of the war. From nineteen fifty to nineteen sixty, the number of children between the ages of five and fourteen increased by more than ten million. The increase in births after the war produced what became known as the baby boom generation. An estimated seventy-eight million Americans were born between nineteen forty-six and nineteen sixty-four. Many of the new parents moved to homes in the new suburbs built outside the urban environment of cities.   (MUSIC) Life was different in the suburbs -- calmer, less crowded than life in the big city. There were all sorts of group activities. There were Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts. Parent-Teacher Associations at school. Outdoor cooking where families gathered in someone s backyard to eat hamburgers hot off the grill. Historian William Manchester described life in the suburbs in this way: The new suburbs were free, open, and honestly friendly to anyone except black people, whose time had not yet come. Manchester wrote, Families moving in found that their new friends were happy to help them get started. Children in the suburbs exchanged toys and clothing almost as though they were group property. When little Bobby outgrew his clothes, his mother gave them to little Billy across the street. People felt safe enough to leave their doors unlocked.  (SOUND: Chevrolet commercial) And it wasn t just two-wheeled transportation that experienced a post war boost. US new car production was stopped during World War Two, to allow those factories to produce airplanes, tanks, and other military vehicles for the war effort. For many years, popular singer Dinah Shore invited optimistic post-war Americans to take to the highway and see their country in a Chevrolet. (MUSIC) Post war prosperity also led Americans to replace outdated home appliances, buy a new refrigerator, or a television set. ANNOUNCER:  Come closer, sweetheart. Say, I don t think that s fair, because we can t get closer.  BETTY FURNESS:  Oh, but you could, if you had one of the new Westinghouse television sets with the exclusive Electronic Magnifier that gives you a big close-up image whenever you want it.  All you do is turn the Electronic Magnifier knob, and there -- you get the heart of the picture. And see? I m close enough to say,  Hello, good looking!   Actress Betty Furness was commercial spokeswoman for Westinghouse. RONALD REAGAN:  And every Sunday night, General Electric brings you the finest motion picture stars on TV -- the great names in comedy ... mystery ... romance.  Every week, a star, all summer long, on the General Electric Theater.  STEVE EMBER: Over at competitor General Electric, actor Ronald Reagan -- later the fortieth president of the United States -- and often referred to as the Great Communicator, was for many years an effective commercial spokesman every week on the GE Theater. (MUSIC) Parents also tried to improve their children s education. In nineteen sixty, parents bought almost three times as many educational books as they did ten years before. Parents also bought millions of dollars  worth of pianos, violins and other musical instruments for their children. "
