info2 : "Songs -  Rosie the Riveter - Praise the Lord - Pass the Ammunition Welcome to THE MAKING OF A NATION -- American history in VOA Special English. I m Steve Ember  The United States entered the 2nd World War in December of 41. Europe had already been at war since 1939. But the United States did not enter WWII until Japanese forces attacked the American naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. After the Japanese attack, Roosevelt increased his demands on American industry. He called for !60,000 warplanes, !45,000 tanks and !20,000 anti-aircraft guns. And he wanted all these within 1 year. A month after the Pearl Harbor raid, Roosevelt organized a special committee to direct military production. He created another group to help companies find men and women for defense work. And he established a new office where the nation s best scientists and engineers could work together to design new weapons. These new government organizations faced several problems. Sometimes factories produced too much of one product and not enough of another. Sometimes tools broke. And some business owners refused to accept government orders. But the weapons were produced, and American troops soon had the guns and supplies they needed. The federal government had to quickly expand its own workforce to meet war needs. Federal spending increased from 6 billion dollars in 1940 to !89,000,000 in 1944. That was 15 times as much spending in just 5 years. Roosevelt had to take strong steps to get the money for all this spending. He put limits on wages. He increased income taxes to as much as !94% on portions of incomes over !$200,000. And he asked the American people to lend money to the federal government. The people answered by purchasing almost !$100,000,000 in war bonds. Many Japanese-Americans served with honor in the United States armed forces. But many Americans were suspicious of anyone whose family had come from Japan. They refused to trust even Japanese-American families who had lived in the United States for more than a century. Many banks refused to lend money to Japanese-Americans. Many stores would not sell to them. The federal government relocated 1000s of Japanese-Americans in California and other states into internment camps. They were released only after the war ended. It was many years before the government officially apologized for mistreating Japanese-Americans. But WWII did lead to progress for another group that was often the target of discrimination: black Americans. Black leaders spoke out. They said it was unfair to fight a war for freedom in Europe while black Americans did not have all the same freedoms as white citizens.  Negros want the same things that white citizens possess -- all their rights, and no force under the sun can stem and block and stop this civil rights revolution which is now underway.  In 1941, a leader in the black community,  A. Philip Randolph, threatened to lead a giant march on Washington for civil rights for blacks. President Roosevelt reacted by issuing an order that made it a crime to deny blacks a chance for jobs in defense industries. He also ordered the armed forces to change some of their rules that discriminated against black service members. Blacks made progress in the military and defense industries. But most other industries still refused to give them an equal chance. Major progress on civil rights would not come until the 9teen fifties and 6ties. Life was busy during the war years. There were many changes in the economy, business, music, race relations and other areas. But in many ways, life continued as it always does. Americans did what they could during the hard years of WWII to keep life on the home front as normal as possible. But almost everyone understood that the 1st job was to support the troops overseas and win the war. This strength of purpose at home gave American soldiers the support they needed. And it also helped President Roosevelt as he negotiated with other world leaders. Diplomacy and foreign relations became much more complex during the war. That will be our story next week. "
