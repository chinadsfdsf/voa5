info2 : "Speech by George Marshall, Winston Churchill Welcome to THE MAKING OF A NATION -- American history in VOA Special English. I m Steve Ember. Britain was once the most powerful nation in the world. It ruled a wide-reaching empire. This week in our series, we look at how British power gave way to American influence after WWII. One can almost name the day when this happened. It was February 21, 1947. British diplomats in Washington called the State Department. They had 2 messages from their government. The 1st was about Greece. The situation there was critical. Greece had been occupied by Germany during the war. Now it was split by a bitter civil war. On one side of the fighting was the Greek royal family supported by Britain. On the other side were communist-led rebels supported by Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. British forces had helped keep Greece from becoming communist at the end of WWII. A few years later, Britain could no longer help. It needed all its strength to rebuild after the war. So, on that February day in 1947, Britain told the United States it would soon end all support for Greece. Britain s 2nd message that day was about Turkey. Turkey was stronger than Greece. But the concern was that it, too, could become communist unless it received outside help. The Soviet Union wanted to block western political and economic influence in central and eastern Europe. It wanted to extend its own influence instead. So, after the war, it forced a number of countries to establish communist governments.  From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic an iron curtain has descended across the Continent.  The British warnings about the communist threat in Greece and Turkey led President Truman to speak to Congress. He said,  I believe that it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.  Truman called on Congress to give him !$400,000,000 in aid for Greece and Turkey. After a brief but intense national debate, Congress agreed. Truman then launched an effort to save the Greek economy and reorganize the Greek army. Soon after that, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union ended their aid to Greek rebels. The civil war in Greece ended. American help for Greece and Turkey was the 1st step in what became known as the  Truman Doctrine.  The goal of this policy was to stop Soviet aggression anywhere in the world. Truman was willing to use military force to stop the spread of communism. But he also believed it was equally important to build up western European nations so they would be strong enough to defend themselves. After the war, President Truman made George Marshall his secretary of state. Marshall had led American troops as a general in WWII. Now, as the nation s top diplomat, he proposed the idea for rebuilding Europe. This idea became known as the  Marshall Plan.  President Truman explained why there had to be a Marshall Plan. People were starving, he said. There had been food riots in France and Italy. There was not enough fuel. People were cold and sick. Tuberculosis was breaking out. As Truman said later,  Something had to be done.  Secretary of State Marshall described the plan during a congressional hearing in Washington.  Why must the United States carry so great a load in helping Europe? The answer is simple. The United States is the only country in the world today which has the economic power and productivity to furnish the needed assistance. The !$6,800,000,000 proposed for the 1st 15 months is less than a single month s charge of the war. The United States offered aid through the Marshall Plan to all countries in Europe. The Soviet Union and its allies refused help. 16 other countries, however, welcomed the aid. From 1948 to 1952, administrators of the Marshall Plan worked with these countries. The United States spent !$13,000,000,000. The plan worked. Agricultural production in Marshall Plan countries increased by !10%. Industrial production increased by !35%. Production in some industries, such as steel, increased by much more. There were political results, as well. Stronger economies helped prevent communists from gaining control of the governments in France and Italy. Some Europeans criticized the Marshall Plan. They said it increased tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union in the years after the war. Yet few could deny that the plan was one of the most successful international economic programs in history. Next week, we look at another way the United States provided aid in postwar Europe-- the Berlin Airlift. "
