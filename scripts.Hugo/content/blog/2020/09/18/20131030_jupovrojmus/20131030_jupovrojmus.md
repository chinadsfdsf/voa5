info2 : "George W. Bush had been in office for less than eight months when the events of September eleventh, two thousand one, took place. The day is remembered as 9-11. On that morning, nineteen al-Qaida terrorists hijacked four large passenger airplanes on the East Coast. The planes were flying to California so they were heavy with fuel. Each group of hijackers included a trained pilot. American Airlines Flight 11 had just left Boston, Massachusetts, when five hijackers seized control of the plane. Shortly before nine o clock, the hijackers crashed the Boeing 767 into the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City. Five other hijackers seized United Airlines Flight 175, another Boeing 767 also on a flight from Boston. They crashed the jet into the South Tower of the World Trade Center a short time after the first plane hit the North Tower. The twin towers each had one hundred ten floors. They were the tallest buildings in New York and among the tallest in the world. They stood a few streets away from the New York Stock Exchange in the heart of the Wall Street financial district in Lower Manhattan. The South Tower of the World Trade Center collapsed just before ten o clock, after burning for almost an hour. The North Tower came down about thirty minutes later. It had been hit first and had burned for one hour and forty-two minutes. Investigators later found that the intense fires from the jet fuel, burning for as long as they had, had caused the structures to fail. The ruins of the two buildings quickly became known as Ground Zero. Another group of hijackers took over American Airlines Flight 77, a Boeing 757. The plane had taken off from Washington Dulles International Airport. The hijackers crashed the plane into the Pentagon, the Department of Defense headquarters across the Potomac River from Washington in Arlington, Virginia. The plane exploded a hole into one of the five sides of the huge building. And four hijackers seized United Airlines Flight 93, another 757. That plane had taken off from Newark, New Jersey. People on the flight learned about the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington through phone calls to loved ones. Some of the forty passengers and crew members fought to retake control of the plane from the hijackers. Air traffic controllers and law enforcement officials struggled to make sense of the events taking place that morning. Flight 93 crashed in a field near the small town of Shanksville, Pennsylvania. The intended target for Flight 93 may have been the Capitol, the building where Congress meets. No one could be sure if other airliners were involved in the terrorist operation. Air traffic controllers began the complex job of getting all planes across the country -- and those heading in over the Atlantic -- onto the ground safely. Canadian officials assisted. They allowed flights from across the Atlantic to land in eastern Canada, including at airports in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and Gander, Newfoundland. Almost three thousand people died in the 9/11 attacks. Most of the victims worked in the World Trade Center. The victims also included rescuers, among them three hundred forty-three New York City firefighters. They died trying to save others. Pictures of missing persons began to appear in the city as loved ones waited and worried. It took months to clear the wreckage of the twin towers. The attacks in New York changed the distinctive skyline of Lower Manhattan. The twin towers -- completed in nineteen seventy-three -- were gone. The economic effects of 9/11 were felt far beyond America s largest city. The New York Stock Exchange stayed closed until September seventeenth. When it reopened, the Dow Jones Industrial Average -- a measure of leading stocks -- fell by what was then its biggest point drop ever in a single day. Thousands of hotel workers and others in the travel industry lost their jobs. The shock and sadness of the 9/11 attacks brought Americans together less than a year after the disputed presidential election. In a show of patriotism, more and more American flags began to appear on homes, cars and businesses. Small American flag pins were worn by many Americans. The attacks pointed to the work of Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaida organization. On September twentieth, President Bush went before a joint session of Congress to declare a war on terror. "
