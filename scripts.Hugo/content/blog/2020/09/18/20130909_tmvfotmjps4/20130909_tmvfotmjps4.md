info2 : "STEVE EMBER: Welcome to THE MAKING OF A NATION -- American history in VOA Special English. I m Steve Ember.  (SOUND: Radio signals from Sputnik) On a cold October day in nineteen fifty-seven, the Soviet Union launched a small satellite into orbit around the Earth. Radio Moscow made the announcement.  RADIO MOSCOW:  The first artificial Earth satellite in the world has now been created. This first satellite was today successfully launched in the USSR.   The world s first satellite was called Sputnik 1. Sputnik was an important propaganda victory for the Soviets in the Cold War with the United States.  Many people believed the nation that controlled space could win any war. And the Soviet Union had reached outer space first. (SOUND: Radio signals from Sputnik) The Soviets took the first step by creating Sputnik. This satellite was about the size of a basketball. It got its power from a rocket. It orbited Earth for three months. \  Within weeks, the Soviets launched another satellite into Earth orbit, Sputnik 2. It was much bigger and heavier than Sputnik 1. It also carried a passenger: a dog named Laika.  (MUSIC) The United States joined the space race about three months later. It launched a satellite from Cape Canaveral, in the southeastern state of Florida. This satellite was called Explorer 1. It weighed about fourteen kilograms. Explorer One went into a higher orbit than either Sputnik. And its instruments made an important discovery. They found an area of radiation about nine hundred-sixty kilometers above Earth. In December, nineteen sixty-eight, the United States launched Apollo 8 with three astronauts. The flight proved that a spacecraft could orbit the moon and return to Earth safely. (SOUND) After those flights, everything was ready.   NASA ANNOUNCER:  Twelve ... eleven ... ten ... nine ... ignition sequence start ... six ... five ... four ... three ... two ... one ... zero. All engines running. Liftoff.  We have a liftoff. Thirty-two minutes past the hour, liftoff of Apollo 11.   On July sixteenth, nineteen sixty-nine, three American astronauts lifted off in Apollo 11. On the twentieth, Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin entered the Lunar module, called the Eagle. Michael Collins remained in the command module, the Columbia.  The two vehicles separated.  (SOUND) It was a dangerous time. The Eagle could crash. Or it could fall over after it landed. That meant the astronauts would die on the moon.  Millions of people watched on television or listened on the radio. They waited for Armstrong s message.  NEIL ARMSTRONG:  Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.   The Eagle has landed. Then they waited again. It took the astronauts more than three hours to complete the preparations needed to leave the Lunar module.  Finally, the door opened. Neil Armstrong climbed down first. He put one foot on the moon. Then, the other foot. And then came his words, from so far away: NEIL ARMSTRONG:  That s one small step for man. One giant leap for mankind.   STEVE EMBER: That s one small step for man. One giant leap for mankind.  WALTER CRONKITE:  Man on the Moon. Oh, boy! Whew, boy!  RADIO COMMUNICATIONS:  OK, were gonna be busy for a minute.   CBS Television newsman Walter Cronkite shared the excitement that he and so many people felt as man first walked on the surface of the moon.  Years later, Cronkite would remember the historical significance (importance) of that moment in nineteen sixty-nine.  WALTER CRONKITE:  It s hard, I think, to imagine our emotions at the moment. It really was something that had to grip you. It was as if you could have stood at the dock and waved goodbye to Columbus. You knew darn good and well that this was the real history in the making.   Armstrong walked around. Soon, Aldrin joined him.  NASA RADIO COMMUNICATION:  They re setting up the flag now.  1969 The two men placed an American flag on the surface of the moon. They also collected moon rocks and soil.  When it was time to leave, they returned to the Eagle and guided it safely away. They reunited with the Columbia and headed for home. The United States had won the race to the moon.  WALTER CRONKITE:  The thing that made this one particularly gripping was that sense of history -- that, if this was successful, this was a date that was going to be in all the history books, for time evermore. I think we sensed that at the time, sitting there at the Cape [Canaveral], watching that great beast get on its way, that this was it.  "
