info2 : "Welcome to THE MAKING OF A NATION -- American history in VOA Special English.  WWII   greatly changed the traditionally limited relationship between American scientists and the federal government. In the early years of the war, the German forces of Adolf Hitler showed the world the strength of their new tanks, guns and other weapons. President Franklin Roosevelt knew that the United States would need to develop modern weapons of its own if it entered the war. For this reason, Roosevelt established a National Defense Research Committee in 9teen forty to support and organize research on weapons. The leader of both groups was Vannevar Bush-- no relation to the future Presidents. He had long experience as a professor of electrical engineering and as an inventor. Many scientists knew him. American scientists and doctors also made great progress in improving the methods of wartime medicine. WWII   may well have been the 1st war in history in which a wounded soldier was more likely to survive than to die. But, in many ways, the most important scientific development of the period was the atomic bomb. In 1939,   Albert Einstein wrote President Roosevelt a letter. The scientist told the President that it might soon be possible to build a powerful weapon-- a weapon that would use the power of the atom. And he urged Roosevelt to get American scientists to build the atomic bomb before German scientists could build one. Roosevelt agreed. He created a special team of scientists. Their work became known as the Manhattan Project. Roosevelt made sure that these scientists got all the money and supplies they needed. Roosevelt died before the scientists could complete their work. But in April 1945,   the scientists told the new President, Harry Truman, that they were almost ready to test their invention. Just 3 months later, they exploded the world s 1st atomic bomb in the desert in the southwestern state of New Mexico. Truman had to make a difficult decision. He knew the atomic bomb would cause widespread death and suffering if it was used on a Japanese city.  On August 6th, 1945,   the 1st atomic bomb fell on the city of Hiroshima. 3 days later, a 2nd A-bomb fell on the city of Nagasaki.  Having found the atomic bomb, we have used it.  We shall continue to use it until we completely destroy Japan s power to make war. Only a Japanese surrender will stop us.  President Truman  It is an awful responsibility which has come to us. We thank God that it has come to us, instead of to our enemy. And we pray that he may guide us to use it in his ways and for his purposes.  The Radiation Effects Research Foundation in Japan estimates that between 150,000    and  246,000    people died within 2 to 4 months of the bombings. The bombings left Japan s rulers with no choice. In less than 1 week, they surrendered. American scientists and engineers proved that a war could be won with research as well as bullets. And all Americans learned how much could be gained when government agencies, scientists and universities worked together for common goals. Roosevelt had understood this long before the war ended. He asked Vannevar Bush to study how the federal government could work with scientists and universities in peacetime. Bush offered a number of ideas to President Truman at the end of the war. He told the President that science was important to America s progress and safety. He called on the federal government to support scientific study and education. Professor Bush said that the nation s universities should be greatly strengthened. He called for the creation of a new government agency to provide money for science projects. Truman and Congress agreed with Vannevar Bush. And in the next few years, American research efforts expanded. In 1946,   the Office of Naval Research was created to support basic science study in universities. In the same year, the government created the Atomic Energy Commission. And in 1950,  it created the National Science Foundation to provide support to 1000s of the nation s best scientists. In the years that followed, American science would grow beyond the wildest dreams of Vannevar Bush and other scientists of his time. Universities would add 1000s of new students along with new laboratories and research centers. By the middle of the 1960s,   the federal government would spend more than 13,000,000,000  a year for research and development. And 500   new centers of higher learning would be created. All this investment would help make the United States the world leader in such fields as computer science, genetics and space travel. "
