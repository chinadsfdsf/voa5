info2 : "Audio - Ford Inauguration - Ford at Congress Inquiry - Brief Saigon Chaos -  Gerald Ford became the only leader in American history to have served both as vice president and president without being elected.  Richard Nixon chose him as vice president in October nineteen-seventy-three. That was when Nixon s former vice president, Spiro Agnew, resigned because of criminal charges that he failed to pay his taxes.  When Nixon himself resigned, Ford became president.  Ford was a longtime congressman from the state of Michigan. He was well-liked by his congressional colleagues. His education was in economics and political science at the University of Michigan. Then he attended Yale Law School. During World War Two, he served as a Naval officer in the Pacific.  After the war, Ford entered politics. He was a member of the Republican Party. He was first elected to the House of Representatives in nineteen forty-eight. He won re-election twelve times. Republicans in the House elected him the minority leader during the administration of Democratic President Lyndon Johnson.  Ford was still minority leader when Richard Nixon, a fellow Republican, was elected president in nineteen sixty-eight. In his leadership position, Ford helped win approval of a number of Nixon s proposals. He became known for his strong loyalty to the president. It was no surprise, then, when Nixon named Ford as vice president.  Gerald Ford was an  accidental president.  He came to office in a sudden turn of events. Almost as suddenly, he had to decide what to do about the former president.    Anger about the pardon was still strong when President Ford made another controversial decision. He pardoned men who had illegally avoided military service in the Vietnam War.  Most of them were not sent to prison. Instead, they were offered a chance to do work for their communities. Many of the men, however, did not accept the president s offer. Some stayed in Canada or other countries where they had fled to avoid the draft.  President Ford received greater public support when he asked Congress to limit the activities of the nation s intelligence agencies. He hoped better control would prevent future administrations from abusing the constitutional rights of Americans, as Nixon had done.  On another issue, Ford, while serving as vice president, had described inflation as America s  public enemy number one.  He had supported several measures to fight it. As president, however, an economic recession forced him to cancel some of those measures. Inflation decreased during the recession, but unemployment increased.  On foreign policy issues, Ford kept Henry Kissinger as secretary of state. Kissinger had won much praise for his service to Richard Nixon, including in the opening of diplomatic ties with Communist China.  But Kissinger had also received much criticism. Critics accused him of interfering with civil liberties in the name of national security. They also accused him of supporting the overthrow of the Marxist government of Salvador Allende in Chile.  By the time Ford became president, the United States and the Soviet Union had taken steps to try to limit the spread of nuclear weapons. Nixon and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev had signed two such agreements as part of the détente policy to ease Cold War tensions. Relations with China were also less tense than before.   American policy in Southeast Asia, however, had failed. Involvement in the Vietnam War had officially ended the year before Gerald Ford became president. But fighting continued between South Vietnam and communist forces from the North.  The peace agreement signed by the United States and North Vietnam in nineteen seventy-three left South Vietnam to defend itself. By nineteen seventy-five, South Vietnamese forces were clearly in danger of defeat.  President Ford tried to prevent a communist takeover. He asked Congress to approve seven hundred million dollars in military aid for South Vietnam. Congress said no. The American people were tired of paying for the war.   Saigon, the South Vietnamese capital, fell to communist forces on April thirtieth, nineteen seventy-five.  President Ford ordered the rescue of American citizens and South Vietnamese who had supported the American efforts. Few people who saw those struggling to escape Saigon will ever forget that day.    Please stop pushing -- one at a time.   Terrified Vietnamese were screaming for help at the American Embassy. Everyone was pushing, trying to escape the city. Some held on to overloaded military helicopters as the aircraft tried to take off.  As a signal to American citizens to prepare to leave, Armed Forces Radio had played the song  White Christmas.   Some were to go to an apartment building where a helicopter would pick them up from the roof. But other people also tried to get onto the helicopter -- a scene captured in a famous news photo of the fall of Saigon.  The former South Vietnamese capital was renamed Ho Chi Minh City. "
