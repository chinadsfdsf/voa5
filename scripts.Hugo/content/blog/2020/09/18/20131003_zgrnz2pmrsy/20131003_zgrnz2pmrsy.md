info2 : "Audio: Perot - That Giant Sucking Sound - Bush - No New Taxes - Clinton - meeting JFK - acceptance speech Nineteen ninety-one was also the last year for the U.S.S.R., the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The collapse of the Soviet Union brought an end to more than forty years of Cold War tensions and fears of nuclear war. In the United States, attention was turning to the nineteen ninety-two presidential election. Many political observers believed President Bush would easily win a second term. Bush was a Republican. Democrats saw his falling popularity as a good opportunity to retake the White House. They placed their hopes on William Jefferson Clinton. At the time, he was the young governor of the southern state of Arkansas. He was gaining national attention by talking about issues like education. Bill Clinton was born on August nineteenth, nineteen forty-six, in the small town of Hope, Arkansas. His name at birth was William Jefferson Blythe. His father, also named William Jefferson Blythe, was a traveling salesman. He died in a car accident three months before his son was born. At the age of two, the boy was sent to live with his grandparents while his mother, Virginia Blythe, studied to become a nurse.  She married a man named Roger Clinton when her son was four. The family moved to Hot Springs, Arkansas. When he was fifteen, William Jefferson Blythe legally changed his name to William Jefferson Clinton. His stepfather drank too much, and was sometimes abusive to him, his mother and his stepbrother, Roger junior. But Bill Clinton did well in school. He also developed a strong early interest in politics and ran for student offices in high school. While he was governor, education in the state improved. More students finished high school, and more went on to college. The state increased requirements for teachers and also increased their pay. Governor Clinton also expanded early learning programs for children from poor families. While governor, Bill Clinton also became active in Democratic Party leadership at the national level.   Make no mistake. This election is about change, change in our party, change in our leadership, change in our nation. And that is why today, I proudly announce my candidacy for president of the United States of America. [Cheering]   In nineteen ninety-one, Bill Clinton announced that he would run for the Democratic nomination for president. His main opponents were Paul Tsongas and Jerry Brown. Tsongas was a former senator from Massachusetts; Brown had been governor of California. Paul Tsongas later withdrew, and Bill Clinton easily defeated Jerry Brown for the nomination.    Democrats held their national nominating convention in New York City in July nineteen ninety-two.   And so, in the name of all those who do the work, pay the taxes, raise the kids, and play by the rules; in the name of the hard-working Americans who make up our forgotten middle class, I proudly accept your nomination for president of the United States.   Bill Clinton chose Senator Al Gore of Tennessee as his running mate for vice president. The Republicans nominated President Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle for a second term.  Another candidate in the nineteen ninety-two presidential election was a Texas businessman named Ross Perot. He competed as an independent, a so-called third party candidate.  During the campaign, Ross Perot argued that neither of the major candidates was taking the national debt seriously enough. He also warned of the loss of American jobs.   To those of you in the audience who are business people, [it s] pretty simple. If you re paying twelve, thirteen dollars, fourteen dollars an hour for factory workers, and you can move your factory south of the border, pay a dollar an hour for your labor, have no health care -- that s the most expensive single element in making a car -- have no environmental controls, no pollution controls, and no retirement, and you don t care about anything but making money, there will be a giant sucking sound going south.    Bill Clinton criticized President Bush for not doing more about the economy and unemployment.  Bush pointed out that the Democrats controlled Congress, and he said the Democrats had defeated most of his proposals.  The president also talked about his foreign policy successes. And -- most famously -- he promised not to raise taxes.   My opponent will not rule out raising taxes, but I will, and the Congress will push me to raise taxes, and I ll say  No.  And they ll push again, and I ll say  Read my lips -- no new taxes.    But raise taxes he did, and many Americans remembered that on Election Day. Bill Clinton and Al Gore won the nineteen ninety-two election. They received about forty five-million votes, or six million more than President Bush and Vice President Quayle. Ross Perot and James Stockdale received close to twenty million -- or nineteen percent of the popular vote. "
