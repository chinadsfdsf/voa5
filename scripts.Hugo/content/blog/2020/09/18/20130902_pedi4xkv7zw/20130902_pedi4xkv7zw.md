info2 : "NBC TV 1948 with results live - Truman speech live - Truman being comedian STEVE EMBER: Welcome to THE MAKING OF A NATION -- American history in VOA Special English. I m Steve Ember HARRY TRUMAN:  I want to say to you, for the next four years, there ll be a Democrat in the White House, and you re looking at him.  (MUSIC) Presidential elections are exciting events in American politics. Few elections for the White House have been as exciting as the one in nineteen forty-eight. And few have had such surprising results. ANNOUNCER:  This is NBC Television.  SENATOR J. HOWARD McGRATH:  We have obtained the results from the state of Ohio which assures victory for President Truman and Senator Barkley. With Ohio s twenty-five electoral votes, President Truman and Senator Barkley will have a total of two hundred and sixty-six votes in the Electoral College.  This is the minimum figure necessary for victory.  (MUSIC) President Truman did choose to run. He took several strong steps to show his leadership in the months following the Democratic defeat in the congressional elections. Truman called on Congress to pass a number of laws to help black people. He took firm actions in his foreign policy toward the Soviet Union. These included the Marshall Plan and the Berlin Airlift, as we discussed in our last two programs. And he began to speak out with much more strength to the American people. Truman succeeded in winning the presidential nomination of the Democratic Party. He chose Alben Barkley, a senator from Alabama, for vice president.  Senator Barkley and I will win this election and make these Republicans like it -- don t you forget that!  Truman declared in accepting the nomination.   The Republicans nominated New York State Governor Thomas Dewey. Dewey was a wise and courageous man. He was also very serious. Truman campaigned by telling the voters that Dewey did not understand the needs of the average American. He called Dewey a candidate of rich people. Dewey also campaigned across the country by train. But he showed little of the fire and emotion in his speeches that made Truman s campaign so exciting. Dewey s speeches were  safe.  One reporter wrote that Dewey was acting like a man who had already been elected and was only passing time, waiting to take office. Dewey had good reasons to feel so sure of being elected. Almost every political expert in the country said Truman had no chance to win. The Wall Street Journal, for example, printed a story about what Dewey would do in the White House after the election. And the New York Times said that Dewey would win the election by a large majority. Truman refused to accept these views. Instead, he spoke with more and more emotion against Dewey. Most Americans still believed that Truman would lose. But they liked his courage in fighting until the end. One supporter shouted  Give  em hell, Harry!  --  them  being the Republicans. Soon supporters across the country were shouting  Give  em hell, Harry!  Republicans across the country greeted Election Day happily. They were sure that this was the day that the people would choose to send a Republican back to the White House after sixteen years. Some of the early voting results from the northeastern states showed Truman winning. But few Republicans worried. They were sure Dewey would be the winner when all the votes were counted. The Chicago Tribune was also sure who the next president would be, declaring in a huge headline  Dewey Defeats Truman.  But the newspaper was wrong. Everyone was wrong. Everyone, that is, except Harry Truman and the Americans who gave him their votes. Truman went to bed on election night before all the votes were counted. He told his assistant that he would win. He awoke early the next morning to learn that he was right. Not only did he defeat Dewey, as he thought he would, but he won by a good number of votes. And he helped many Democratic congressional candidates win as well. The Democrats captured both houses of Congress. After the results were announced, as heard in this old recording Truman showed his sense of humor by joking about the predictions of his defeat. HARRY TRUMAN:  I had on the National Broadcasting Company and [commentator HV] Kaltenborn was saying  While the president is a million votes ahead in the popular vote, we have yet to hear from [words drowned out by applause], and we are very sure that when the country votes come in, Mr. Truman will be defeated by an overwhelming majority.  And I went back to bed and went to sleep.  "
