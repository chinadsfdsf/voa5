info2 : "Welcome to THE MAKING OF A NATION -- American history in VOA Special English. I m Steve Ember. Some political observers thought Nixon would not win a second term. Nixon, however, was sure the American people would support him.  He did not actively campaign in the state primary elections leading up to the Republican nominating convention. He focused much of his attention on foreign policy -- including his historic trip to China in February nineteen seventy-two. In May he traveled to Austria, the Soviet Union, Iran and Poland. In Moscow, he signed the first Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty, or SALT, with the Soviets.  But back in Washington, something happened. It was a small incident, but one that would have a huge effect.   On June seventeenth, nineteen seventy-two, five men wearing surgical gloves broke into the headquarters of the Democratic Party. The Democratic National Committee offices were located in one of the buildings in a complex called Watergate. Police caught the burglars and, at the time, the incident did not seem very important.  But the men carried papers that linked them to top officials in the Nixon White House. The question was: Did the President know what was going on? Nixon denied any wrongdoing.  In time, the Watergate break-in would lead to a congressional investigation.   But, in the summer of nineteen seventy-two, attention focused on the presidential nominating conventions. Democrats met in Miami Beach, Florida, and chose George McGovern, a senator from South Dakota, as their candidate for president.  The Republicans also met in Miami Beach and, as expected, nominated Richard Nixon for a second term.  McGovern, a liberal, attacked Nixon for his policies on Vietnam. However, Nixon easily won the nineteen seventy-two election. He defeated McGovern, carrying forty-nine of the fifty states. Two young reporters for the Washington Post, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, had been following the story since the break-in. In early nineteen seventy-three, they found evidence that linked the break-in to White House officials. The evidence also showed that these officials tried to use government agencies to hide the connection.  The burglars had been financed with money connected to the Committee to Re-Elect the President.  The Watergate drama has taken a half-year to unfold. The president s unique actions in firing two popular and respected members of the Executive Branch, and forcing a third to quit, took less than eight hours. The impact of all this, clearly colossal, and yet to be measured.   Jerry Landay, reporting for ABC News.   The incident happened on a Saturday night and became known as the  Saturday Night Massacre.   Nixon then had acting Attorney General Robert Bork dismiss Cox, and the President eliminated the office of special prosecutor. He gave the Justice Department the responsibility of continuing the investigation. President Nixon asked Gerald Ford to become the new vice president. Ford was a longtime member of Congress from Michigan. Congress moved ahead with efforts to bring charges against the president.   Congress has no alternative now but to institute impeachment proceedings.    In July nineteen seventy-four, a committee in the House of Representatives proposed to impeach Nixon. That is, put the President on trial in the Senate. If Nixon were found guilty of crimes connected to the Watergate case, he would be removed from office.  Finally, Nixon surrendered the last of the documents sought by congressional investigators. These documents appeared to provide proof that the President had ordered a cover-up of evidence in the Watergate burglary.   Every President promises to protect and defend the Constitution. The congressional investigation showed that Nixon had repeatedly misused government agencies in an effort to hide wrongdoing and punish his critics. The hearings also showed that he had tried to block the investigation.   By resigning, Nixon avoided impeachment and possible imprisonment. Never before had an American President resigned. On August ninth, Nixon s vice president, Gerald Ford, was sworn-in as the nation s thirty-eighth president.  Soon after becoming president, Gerald Ford made a surprise announcement.   He pardoned Richard Nixon. Many Americans criticized Ford for doing this. But the new President believed he had good reason.  Ford wanted to deal with the other problems facing the nation. He did not want Watergate to go on and on. But the investigation did go on. A number of officials in the Nixon administration went to prison.  The effects of Watergate on public opinion and public policy would be felt for years to come. "
