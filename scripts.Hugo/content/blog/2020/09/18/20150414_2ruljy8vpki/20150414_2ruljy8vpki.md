info2 : "Making of a Nation - 14 Apr 2015 - VOA This week, Americans remember an important date in history: 150 years ago, President Abraham Lincoln was killed. Museums and historic organizations all around the country have special exhibits and events. President Lincoln was the first American President to be assassinated. It happened in 1865 at Ford’s Theater in Washington, D.C. This month, the theater is showing objects from that tragic night. The objects are on display together for the first time. More than 150 Civil War living historians will be at Ford’s Theater. They will recreate the events after the shooting. On April 14, 1865, Abraham Lincoln and his wife Mary sat in the Presidential box at Ford s Theatre in Washington. They were watching a play, “Our American Cousin.” Everyone heard a gunshot, and the President fell. The gunman was John Wilkes Booth, an actor. He supported the Confederate side in the Civil War. After he shot President Lincoln, Mr. Booth shouted  Sic semper tyrannis.  This Latin phrase means  thus ever to tyrants.  Then he dropped his gun and ran away. Mr. Lincoln was carried to a house across the street where he died the next morning. Many people believe Mr. Lincoln is one of this country s greatest and most beloved Presidents. He died just as he was leading the nation out of a long and bloody Civil War. More than 620,000 soldiers died in that war between the Union and the Confederacy. Michelle Krowl is a historian at the Library of Congress. She considers saving the Union one of the most important successes of his presidency.  There were times when Lincoln was not sure that the war would necessarily be won. But he saw the United States as an experiment in democracy … he didn t want that experiment in democracy to fail and his perseverance helped make sure that it didn t fail.” Ms. Krowl adds that,  When you read the Gettysburg Address and he says  this is a Government of the people, by the people, for the people,  he meant that.” Historian Martin Johnson says the Gettysburg Address became popular and important very quickly because it told people the lesson of the War in a very short speech. After the War, Johnson says, the speech was recited  over and over, hundreds of times across the Union and elsewhere... it became rooted very quickly in American memory about what the Civil War meant.    School children around the world learn the speech as part of their lessons in English because it is recognized as one of the finest speeches by any American.” Michelle Krowl says Lincoln s language ability came from his love of storytelling. He was also a patient man, with a great sense of humor, and was a devoted father. She said,  You really see the more tender side of Lincoln when you hear or read about him interacting - particularly with his sons Willie and Todd during their White House years.” Tracey Avant is Curator of Exhibitions at Ford s Theatre. She says one of the objects on display shows that tender side. It is his signature top hat. The hat is in the exhibit, ‘Silent Witnesses: Artifacts of the Lincoln Assassination.” "
