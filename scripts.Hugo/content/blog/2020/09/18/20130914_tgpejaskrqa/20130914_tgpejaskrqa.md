I m Steve Ember This week in our series, we begin the story of President Lyndon Johnson.  (MUSIC) WALTER CRONKITE (CBS TV):  From Dallas Texas, the flash, apparently official, President Kennedy died at 1 PM Central Standard Time, two o clock Eastern Standard Time.  Lyndon Baines Johnson became America s thirty-sixth president suddenly.  WALTER CRONKITE:  Vice President Lyndon Johnson has left the hospital in Dallas. Presumably, he will be taking the oath of office shortly, and become the thirty-sixth President of the United States.   On November twenty-second, nineteen sixty-three, President John Kennedy was murdered.  Kennedy and Johnson, his vice president, were in Dallas, Texas. Kennedy was shot as his open car drove through the city. Within a few hours, Johnson was sworn into office. The swearing-in took place on the presidential plane, Air Force One, at Dallas  Love Field.  The plane returned to Andrews Air Force Base near Washington carrying the new president and the body of the former president.  At Andrews, President Johnson read a brief statement. He ended with these words:  I will do my best. That is all I can do. I ask for your help, and God s.   (MUSIC) Before he was vice president, LBJ had served for many years in the Senate and the House of Representatives. He grew up in small towns in Texas. He finished high school at age fifteen. He traveled and worked for a few years before he entered Southwest Texas State Teachers College. There he was a student leader and a political activist.  In nineteen thirty-one a newly elected congressman asked Johnson to work for him as his secretary in Washington. Four years later, President Franklin Roosevelt appointed Johnson as Texas director of Roosevelt s National Youth Administration.   Two years after that, in nineteen thirty-seven, Johnson won a special election for a seat in the House of Representatives. He served in the House for twelve years. When the United States entered World War Two, Johnson was the first member of Congress at that time to volunteer for active duty. After the war, he ran for the Senate, where he also served for twelve years.  Johnson loved politics and became an expert in the operations of government. He would need all of that knowledge as president of a nation facing problems near and far.  (SOUND: Vietnam War gunfire) When Johnson took office, communist forces were fighting South Vietnamese troops supported by the United States. Also there were continuing worries about nuclear war with the Soviet Union. At home, there was racial conflict. Many Americans were out of work, and there was the threat of a railroad strike.  Johnson began his presidency by working hard for legislation that President Kennedy had proposed. Johnson had voted against civil rights legislation when he served in the Senate. But now he urged Congress to support the idea, and Congress agreed.  The nineteen sixty-four Civil Rights Act barred discrimination against minorities in jobs and in restaurants and other businesses.  Johnson launched the War on Poverty, a series of bills designed to help the poor. But his efforts to pay for social programs and a war overseas led to inflation.  Vietnam was not the only place where Johnson used military force. In nineteen sixty-five he sent more than twenty thousand troops to intervene in the Dominican Republic. He worried that a revolution could lead to a communist takeover of that Caribbean nation.  (MUSIC) Unlike the Democrats, the Republicans had a difficult time choosing their presidential candidate. Delegates at the party s nominating convention finally chose Barry Goldwater. Goldwater was a strongly conservative senator from Arizona.  The Republican candidate for vice president was William Miller, a congressman from New York State.  Americans voted in November of nineteen sixty-four. Lyndon Johnson won more than sixty percent of the popular vote. Still he had hoped for an even bigger victory. He wanted proof that Americans were voting for him, and not the shadow of John Kennedy.  In his inaugural speech, Johnson said his Great Society would never be finished -- it would keep growing and improving.  In nineteen sixty-seven, President Johnson appointed the nation s first black justice to the Supreme Court, Thurgood Marshall.  ANTI-WAR DEMONSTRATORS:  Hell no, we won t go!   Around the country, President Johnson faced growing opposition to the war in Vietnam. More and more American troops were dying.  Lyndon Johnson may have wanted to be remembered as a great president, but the war came to redefine his presidency. That will be our story next week. "
