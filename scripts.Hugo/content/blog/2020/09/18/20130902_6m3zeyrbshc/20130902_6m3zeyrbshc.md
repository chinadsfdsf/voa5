I m Steve Ember  This week in our series, we continue the story of America s thirty-third President, Harry Truman. One of the major issues during Truman s 2nd term was fear of communism. After WWII,  Americans watched as one eastern European nation after another became an ally of the Soviet Union. Soviet leader Josef Stalin wanted to see communism spread around the world. And Americans watched as China became communist in 1949, as forces led by Mao Zedong defeated the Chinese Nationalists after a civil war that had lasted more than 10 years. During this tense period, there were charges that communists held important jobs in the United States government. These fears, real or imagined, became known as the  Red Scare.   Even if there were only one communist in the State Department --- Even if there were only one Communist in the State Department, that would still be one communist too many.  A Republican senator from Wisconsin, Joseph McCarthy, led the search for communists in America. In speeches and congressional hearings, he accused 100s of people of being communists or communist supporters. His targets included the State Department, the Army and the entertainment industry. Senator McCarthy often had little evidence to support his accusations. Many of his charges would not have been accepted in a court of law. But the rules governing congressional hearings were different. So he was able to make his accusations freely. Many people lost their jobs after they were denounced as communists. Some had to use false names to get work. A few went to jail briefly for refusing to cooperate with McCarthy. The senator continued his anti-communist investigations for several years. By the early 1950s, however, more people began to question his methods. Critics said he violated democratic traditions. In 1954, the Senate finally voted to condemn his actions. McCarthy died 3 years later. MacArthur strongly believed he could end the war quickly by extending it to the Chinese mainland. He publicly denounced Truman s policy, saying  There is no substitute for victory.  Truman felt that the general left him no choice. In April of 1951, he dismissed MacArthur.  It was with the deepest personal regret that I found myself compelled to take this action. General MacArthur is one of our greatest military commanders. But the cause of world peace is much more important than any individual.  In the United States, military leaders are expected to obey their commander in chief-- the President. While some Americans approved of the general s dismissal, many others supported MacArthur. 1,000,000s greeted him when he returned to the United States. There were huge parades in his honor in San Francisco and New York. In fact, few leaders in the 20th century could boast the support MacArthur had. Almost !7,000,000 people attended the ticker tape parade given to him by New York City. And that almost doubled the size of the one given to another returning WWII hero, General Dwight Eisenhower. MacArthur gave his farewell speech to a joint session of Congress on April 19, 1951.  I am closing my 52 years of military service. When I joined the Army, even before the turn of the century, it was the fulfillment of all of my boyish hopes and dreams. The world has turned over many times since I took the oath on the plain at West Point, and the hopes and dreams have long since vanished, but I still remember the refrain of one of the most popular barrack ballads of that day which proclaimed most proudly that old soldiers never die; they just fade away. And like the old soldier of that ballad, I now close my military career and just fade away, an old soldier who tried to do his duty as God gave him the light to see that duty. Goodbye.  On the Korean peninsula, the war continued. Ceasefire talks began in July of 1951. But the conflict would last for another 2 years until a truce was declared. The Korean War armistice agreement was signed on July 27th, 1953. 1952 was a Presidential election year in the United States. Harry Truman was losing popularity because of the continuing war in Korea and economic problems at home. At the same time, Dwight Eisenhower, a military hero from WWII,  was thinking of running for President as the Republican candidate. Harry Truman had made many difficult decisions as President. In March of 1952, he made one more. He announced that he would not be a candidate for re-election. The 1952 Presidential election will be our story next week. "
