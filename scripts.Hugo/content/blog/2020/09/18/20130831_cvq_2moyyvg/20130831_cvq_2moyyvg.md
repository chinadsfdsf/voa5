info2 : "Audio Interview with Mr. Wiggly Wings Welcome to THE MAKING OF A NATION -- American history in VOA Special English. I m Steve Ember The 2nd World War ended with the surrender of Japan in August 1945. Americans looked to their new President, Harry Truman, to lead them into a new time of peace. Truman was Vice President until President Franklin Roosevelt died suddenly in the closing months of the war. . In November of 1946, the people voted in congressional and state elections. The results showed they were not satisfied with Truman and his Democratic Party. Republicans won control of both houses of Congress for the 1st time in 18 years. And Republicans were elected governor in 25 states. The election was a serious defeat for the Democrats-- but a disaster for Truman. Some members of his party even called on him to resign. Few people gave Truman much chance of winning the next Presidential election in 1948. After the war, the Allies had divided Germany in half. West Germany had a democratic government. East Germany was communist, under Soviet control. The Soviet actions in Berlin were a direct threat to the west. Truman had 3 difficult choices. If he did nothing, the world would think the United States was weak and unable to stop Soviet aggression. If he fought the blockade with force, he might start a 3rd world war. But there was another choice. The Allies proposed the idea of flying tons of food, fuel and other supplies into West Berlin. Not just once, but every day, as long as the Russians continued their blockade. It would be a difficult job. West Berlin was home to !2,500,000 people. No one had ever before tried to supply so large a city by air. Planes would have to take off every !3 1/2, day and night, to supply the people with enough food, medicine, clothing, and badly needed coal. Brigadier General Joseph Smith was appointed task force commander of the American part of the airlift. General Smith called the mission  Operation Vittles,  using an American slang term for food.  Operation Vittles  also led to  Operation Little Vittles  for the dropping of chocolates and other treats to children. The pilots who did this became known as  Candy Bombers.  Appreciative German children called them  Die Schokoladen Flieger  -- the chocolate pilots.  They wanted to know which airplane I was in. I said,  you can tell my airplane -- I ll wiggle the wings and you ll know it s me -- Watch just that airplane.  They said  That s good.  Wunderbar [wonderful].   I came back the next day and I put little parachutes for the Kaugummi [chewing gum] and the Schokoladen [chocolates], so they could see it and so it wouldn t hit them hard in the head, slow it down. And so I wiggled the wings and they waved their hands, and I pushed it out of the airplane. And that s how it started.  It was the idea of Gail Halvorsen, a pilot in the United States Air Force. Lieutenant Halvorsen became known as  Mister Wiggly Wings.  From his plane, he would drop chewing gum and chocolates attached to tiny parachutes made from handkerchiefs. Soon, many of the Airlift pilots were dropping candy from their planes, including into Soviet-controlled areas that they flew over. Americans back home supplied the handkerchiefs and the US chocolate industry supplied the treats. Years later, in Berlin, Gail Halvorsen told German interviewer Ralf Gruender how he got the idea.  I dropped chocolate because of gratitude. I met 30 children at the fence at Tempelhof, and not one put out their hand and said give me more than flour, give me more than coal, give me chocolate. They had no chocolate.  They had no gum. But they would not be a beggar. They were so grateful for flour and I said wow, they were thankful. And when people are thankful, good things happen.  It soon became clear to the Soviets that the Berlin Airlift would succeed. In May of 1949, almost one year after they had started their blockade, they ended it. The crisis in Berlin changed the way many Americans saw their President. Harry Truman no longer seemed so weak or unsure of himself. Instead, he was acting as a leader who could take an active part in world affairs. Truman s popularity increased. However, most Americans did not expect him to win the election in 1948. Almost everyone believed that the Republican candidate, New York Governor Thomas Dewey, would capture the office. The election campaign that year turned out to be one of the most exciting and surprising in the history of the nation. That will be our story next week. "
