info2 : "Welcome to THE MAKING OF A NATION -- American history in VOA Special English. I m Steve Ember. This week in our series, we look at the Presidential election of 2000. It was an election that few Americans would soon forget.  The Presidential race looks jar-lid-tight. We could be in for a long night, as voters decide whether Vice President Al Gore or Texas Governor George Bush will be the next President of the United States. It is that close.  In 2000, Americans were preparing to elect a new President in November. The United States Constitution limits Presidents to 2 terms. Bill Clinton would be leaving office. So his Democratic Party needed to choose a new candidate. Public opinion surveys showed that the race between George Bush and Al Gore would be extremely close. The election took place on November 7th. More than  100,000,000 people voted for them. Al Gore received about  540,000 more of those votes than George Bush did. But winning the popular vote does not make someone President. Americans do not directly elect their President. When they vote for a candidate, what they are really doing is voting for electors. The number of electors for each state is based on the size of its congressional delegation, which is based on population. These electors then vote in December in a system known as the Electoral College. The Electoral College officially elects the President. In the 2000 election, there were 538 electors in the Electoral College. To become President, the winner needed a simple majority of 270. Al Gore won the popular vote, but neither he nor George Bush won a majority of the electoral votes. Not that any of this was clear on Election Night.  Bulletin: Florida pulled back into the undecided column. This thing is so wild, wacky, and woolly, nobody knows how it s going to come out.   ... as CNN right now is moving Florida to the too-close-to-call column ...     ... too close to call ...   Florida is now too close to call. [I] want to say that again, it s a confusing situation. Now, if you re disgusted with us, frankly I don t blame you.  The disputed election results in Florida introduced a new term into popular speech. Americans began talking about  chads.  Whether it was  hanging chads,   pregnant chads  or  dimpled chads,  it amounted to the same problem. It meant that a voting machine had not cleanly punched out a bit of paper, called a chad, when the voter made a choice. As a result, the ballot would confuse a vote-counting machine and make the choice unreadable. That, in turn, meant election workers had to look at each questionable ballot and try to decide the voter s choice. All this took place with the nation-- and the world-- watching and wondering who would become America s next President. Something else only added to anger and debate over the situation in Florida. Florida s Secretary of State, its chief election officer, Katherine Harris, also happened to be a leader of the Bush campaign there.  Governor George W. Bush --  2,900,790.  Almost 3 weeks after the election, Florida officials declared George Bush the winner of the state s 275 electoral votes. That gave him a total of 271. Out of  6,000,000 ballots, state officials said he had defeated Al Gore by 537 votes. But the election was still not over. Gore and his supporters in Florida asked the courts to reject the results because of what they said were the many voting problems. The Florida Supreme Court ordered another count of the disputed ballots. Bush campaign officials quickly appealed to the United States Supreme Court. The court said Florida law did not explain how officials should judge the ballots. The court found the situation in Florida unconstitutional because there were different standards around the state. The justices also said not enough time remained to settle the issue before the Electoral College had to meet. On December 12th, the court voted 7 to 2 to end the recount, and 5 to 4 against ordering a new one. 6 days later, on December 18th, members of the Electoral College met in each state capital and the District of Columbia. They made the election official. George W. Bush would become the 43rd President of the United States. "
