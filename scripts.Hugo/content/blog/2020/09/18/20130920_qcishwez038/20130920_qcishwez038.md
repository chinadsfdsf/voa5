info2 : "The year is nineteen sixty-nine. Richard Nixon, a Republican, is in the first year of his first term in office. His biggest foreign policy problem is the continuing war in Vietnam. During the election campaign, Nixon had promised to do something to end the war.  The question was: what? For Richard Nixon, the war is a terrible test. If he fails, his presidency could end the way Lyndon Johnson s presidency ended. Johnson decided not to run for re-election after he lost public and political support for his war policies.  Presidents have advisers, and Nixon s most important adviser was Henry Kissinger. Kissinger was an expert on foreign relations. He later served as Nixon s secretary of state. Together, they tried many ways to settle the conflict in Vietnam. It took several years before    The Nixon administration also started bombing North Vietnam again. Lyndon Johnson had stopped the raids a few years earlier.   Efforts to end American involvement in Vietnam did not begin immediately. For his first eight months in office, President Nixon made no major policy changes. Then, in October nineteen sixty-nine, he ordered the withdrawal of sixty thousand troops.  He said he acted to speed the peace talks. He also ordered American commanders to give the South Vietnamese most of the responsibility for fighting. Nixon tried to explain to the American people why he was not ordering an immediate withdrawal. In his words:  It is not the easy way. It is the right way.   In the spring of nineteen seventy, American and South Vietnamese troops invaded Cambodia. Many Americans had accepted the war, but as it continued, and as more Americans died in Vietnam, public opinion changed.  In nineteen sixty-five, sixty-one percent of those questioned said they approved of the war. By nineteen seventy-one, sixty-one percent said they did not approve of it.  President Nixon wanted to address the public s anger over the war. So he announced that Henry Kissinger had held twelve secret meetings with North Vietnamese officials. But those secret meetings made no more progress than the official talks.  In late March nineteen seventy-two, North Vietnam launched a major offensive. In May, Nixon ordered increased bombing against roads and railways in the north. By the end of August, the communist offensive had been stopped. Yet many lives had been lost. The pressure to withdraw American forces grew stronger.  For the next five months, the Nixon administration continued a policy of official talks, secret meetings and increased military action. Finally, the president announced that an agreement had been reached at the peace talks in Paris. There would be a ceasefire, and negotiators from the United States, South Vietnam, North Vietnam and the Viet Cong would sign the agreement.  Under the terms of the agreement, all American and allied forces would withdraw from South Vietnam. The north and south would be free to settle their conflict without interference from other countries.    Yet the fighting continued -- and would continue even after Nixon resigned from office in nineteen seventy-four.   April thirtieth, nineteen seventy-five, marked the fall of Saigon, the South Vietnamese capital, after the withdrawal of American troops. The North Vietnamese had planned a two-year campaign to take Saigon; it would take them just fifty-five days.   Another foreign policy issue for the Nixon administration was China. Here was Nixon s chance to shine as a statesman.  Communists took power in China in nineteen forty-nine. The United States, however, did not recognize the Communist Party government on the mainland. Instead, it recognized the Nationalist Chinese government in Taiwan.  In the early nineteen seventies, the Nixon administration began trying to improve relations. It eased restrictions on travel to China. And it supported a visit to China by the United States table-tennis team -- so-called  ping-pong diplomacy.   Then President Nixon made a surprise announcement. He himself would visit China.   The historic event took place in February nineteen seventy-two. Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai and Party Chairman Mao Zedong greeted the American president. Nixon and Zhou held talks that opened new possibilities for trade. The next year, Nixon sent a representative to open a diplomatic office in Beijing. After more than twenty years, the two countries were communicating again.  They would not establish full relations, however, until nineteen seventy-nine, when the United States stopped recognizing Taiwan.  Many Americans were happy at the easing of tensions with China, even as the Cold War with the Soviet Union continued.   Many were proud to see their president standing at the Great Wall of China. Historians would later it call it the greatest moment in the presidency of Richard Nixon. "
